    "This probability puzzle gives a counterintuitive result to many, although it really shouldn't. I believe I have a simpler explanation as well as a way to generalize it.Let's think about what this question is asking really asking. A possible sequence of rolls might look like this \n",

    "Why? Because we assume that when we get a 'bad' result we start over, or ignore the result. So let's start by asking ourselves a slightly different question. What is the probability of a rolling dice of 6 with sequence length 1 (no previous sequences of even values or anything).\n",

    "First we roll the die and probability it will land is simply $\\frac{1}{6}$ of course.\n",

Or we get and odd number $1,3,5$ and we start over, potentially giving us another chance to roll a 6 on the first try. Thus we write this as a recursive probability. \n",

That is you multiply the probability of successful rolls of length $i$ followed the probability of hitting a 1,3,or 5. Because dice is rolling memoryless you are back where you are started and you so simply multiply the probability of rolling a sequence of length 1.\n",
